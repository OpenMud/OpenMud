# OpenMud

Project Website: https://openmud.github.io


## What is it?

OpenMud is a compiler which enables a user (ranging from developers to creative individuals with little to no development background) to compile their own MUD games. OpenMud aims to be compatible with a large subset of Dream Maker projects, and compiles your code into behaviourally consistent CIL code (.Net Assemblies). Additionally, the project incorporates an orchestration and simulation layer to leverage these compiled binaries and simulate / ultimately execute the Dream Maker worlds. Effectively, OpenMud is a compiler and a game engine.

OpenMud also implements all of the core client and server side logic necessary to run your game, while also leaving the door open for extensive customizations for advanced developers.
